An online Book selling website

Hello, this is a project on Web Programming where I along with my team mates made an Online Book Selling Website. The front-end of the project has been made usning HTML, CSS and Javascript and the backend is made using PHP. 

It's a website where a customer is able to buy books after he has signed-up successfully to our website. There is also a log-in page of customer which helps us as well as the customer himself to keep track of his/her activity and other details.
